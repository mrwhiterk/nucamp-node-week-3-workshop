Question #1: What in the code from the exercises during this week could be considered a security risk?

When we were first storing plain text passwords from the basic auth header. Password should be encrypted. We also need to make sure knew users always default to admin false so that we control authorization tasks on our server.

Question #2: What are the most common risks when developing an authentication system?
We need to make sure if were using a third-party service like passport that it is reputable and reliable as we are giving power and our user credentials to them.

Question #3: What are you planning to do when developing user authentication in your portfolio project?
I'm goin to read the passport documentation and setup my environment to use the strategy that most fits my use case.
